"""Upload a rendered short to YouTube via the YouTube Data API v3, used by
the fully-automatic work path (webui/server.py's /auto-jobs and the
scheduler) to publish straight through without a worker manually using
Studio - plus the handful of other calls webui/server.py's in-app "공개
전환" library screen needs to manage what got uploaded (checking status,
publishing, deleting, adding to a playlist) without leaving the app either.

Requires a Google Cloud OAuth client (client_secret.json) for a project
with the YouTube Data API v3 enabled, placed next to the app's .env. The
first call on a machine opens a real browser window for whoever's running
it to sign into the department's YouTube channel once (installed-app OAuth
flow - this is a local desktop tool, same as the rest of the app); after
that, a refresh token is cached on disk and reused silently.

SCOPES covers full video management (upload/update/delete/playlists), not
just upload - if youtube_token.json was created by an older build that only
ever requested the upload-only scope, delete that file once to force a
fresh consent screen covering the wider scope; a cached token can't silently
gain scopes it wasn't originally granted.
