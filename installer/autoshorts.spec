# PyInstaller spec for a portable, onedir build of autoshorts.
#
# Build with: pyinstaller installer/autoshorts.spec --distpath dist --workpath build
# (installer/build.bat does this, plus fetching ffmpeg first - run that
# instead of calling pyinstaller directly, unless you're just iterating on
# this spec file itself.)
#
# onedir (not onefile): a single .exe is nicer to hand out, but onefile
# re-extracts every bundled binary (ffmpeg.exe, faster-whisper's ctranslate2
# native libs, opencv) into a fresh temp directory on *every* launch, which
# is slow and fragile for a bundle this size. The dist/autoshorts/ folder
# this produces (with autoshorts.exe inside) is what actually gets zipped
# and handed to other departments - "double-click autoshorts.exe" is still
# a one-click experience even though it's technically inside a folder.

# >= 6's onedir mode buries `datas` inside _internal/, but those two need to
# sit directly next to the built .exe where a non-technical worker will
# actually look for them (and where installer/launcher.py looks for them at
# runtime). installer/build.bat copies them in as a plain post-build step.

# faster_whisper ships a non-Python data file (its VAD model,
# assets/silero_vad_v6.onnx) that PyInstaller's static analysis has no way
# to discover on its own - it only follows Python imports. Without this,
# the frozen app builds and starts fine but fails with an
# ONNXRuntimeError/NO_SUCHFILE the first time it actually tries to
# transcribe audio (whisper_transcribe's vad_filter=True), since that model
# file just isn't in the bundle. collect_data_files grabs every non-code
# file the installed package ships, not just this one, so any future
# faster_whisper asset gets bundled the same way automatically.
